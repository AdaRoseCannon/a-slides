* Let's say we have an app like so
* and we want to animate prepending an element to the start,
* here we have an issue because as you can see height changes which pushes many elements around the page because of this change,
* so it's expensive because it's a layout operation and much worse because the whole page will change
* but following on from earlier before we insert the new notification we can measure how everything will change
* then animate the change.
* when doing something like this it is best to front load all of the dom read/writes so the app is responsive as the animation finishes.
* if it is a dom change on a button click then you have about a whole 100ms to measure and write to the DOM before it feels sluggish.
* (? perhaps also take this time to perform a prefetch)
* this method follows up from a great talk given by paul lewis at the chrome dev summit

-------
Follow it through in detail
* Measure everything we want to measure.
* store the current animation so it can be restored later set it to ‘0s’
* store the current transform so it can be restored later
* Perform the function
* Measure the new positions, sizes,
* Anything which has changed size: scale it and all give all of its children the inverse transform.
* * Give all the children the offset of the top left of the parent
* * Give them the inverse scale
* apply the translations to move everything to its new place
* apply the new transition to everything affected
* set all of the transforms to their original values
* watch everything smoothly animate.
* on transitionend
* * restore the transitions
* * fire any callbacks
