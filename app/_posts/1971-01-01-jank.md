* Jank is when the frame takes longer to layout and render than 16ms to hit fps. Causes a stutter it feels bad.
* Shows up in the timeline as very tall bars
* Caused by slow synchronous eventsmost commonly Layouts and Paints

--------

* Layout is slowest
* Making a small DOM change could potentially invalidate the entire DOM tree causing it to be recalculated
* An invalidated DOM is recalculated whenever a layout property is read and each rendered 

--------

* Paint is medium slow
* This is where the layer's bitmap has been invalidated and needs to be redrawn and stored in memory
* This is done on each render

--------

* Composite is very fast
* Composite only involves the graphics card rerendering from bitmaps calculated in paint

--------

* (CSS triggers is a great resource it lists whether a change involves Just composite, paint and composite or layout paint and composite.)
