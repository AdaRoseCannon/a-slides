However most commonly on a typical webpage it is caused by the layouts and paints used to render the page.

üê¢ Layout is slowest. Layout is where the browser calculates the positions and sizes of all the elements in the page. Making a small DOM change could potentially invalidate the entire DOM tree causing it to be recalculated.

An invalidated DOM is recalculated whenever a layout property is read as well as when each frame is rendered. This means layout could need to be recalculated many times in a single frame.

If an element's layout needs to be recalculated it also has its bitmap in memory invalidated, so it needs to be repainted.

üê¢ Paint is medium-slow. This is where the layer's bitmap has been invalidated and needs to be redrawn and stored in memory. Aside from when its layout changes this will also happen when its appearance changes, such as background, font or color.

üê∞ Composite is very fast. Composite only involves the graphics card rerendering from bitmaps calculated in paint and stored in memory: it is performed when the page is being drawn to the screen. It is triggered by gfx card-only operations such as transform, clipping and opacity.
