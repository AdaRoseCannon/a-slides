* Writing to DOM is free, you can write as much as you want
* Once the DOM is read if it has been invalidated it needs to be recalculated which is expensive
* One common problem is reading then writing in a loop which thrashes the DOM; the layout is invalidated and recalculated on every single read.
* Which could mean multiple layout operations per frame
* The second is animating properties which cause layouts on the DOM. Even for this simple layout having to recalculate the layout every frame is making my laptop's fan spin up.

-----------
* The fix for the first situation tends to be fairly simple: batch your reads and write all together. Don't change a property then immediately read it.
* E.g.Don't append to an `innerhtml` in a loop INSTEAD add it to a seperate string and update the `innerHTML` in one go.
### Fastdom slide
* In an mvc or a large framework with many independent modules it can be difficult to ensure modules do not interleave read and writes Wilson Page's fastdom library can help with this so that reads and writes in a single frame all get done together.
* A good general motto is to calculate all DOM changes first then apply them in a single step.
