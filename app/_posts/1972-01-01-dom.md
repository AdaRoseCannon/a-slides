Writing to DOM is free; you can write as much as you want.

Once the DOM is read if it has been invalidated by being written to the layout needs to be recalculated, which is expensive.

One common problem is reading, then writing in a loop, which is known as layout thrashing; the layout is invalidated and recalculated on every single read.
Interleaving reads and writes could mean multiple expensive layout operations per frame.

One fix for DOM thrashing tends to be fairly simple: batch your reads and writes all together. Especially don't change a property then immediately read it.

For example don't append to `innerhtml` in a loop INSTEAD build up a string and then write that string to the `innerhtml`.

In an mvc or a large framework with many independent modules it can be difficult to ensure modules do not interleave read and writes. Wilson Page's <a href="https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom" target="_blank">fastdom library</a> can help with this so that reads and writes in a single frame all get done together.

*** Cut to example of what fastdom does***

Often a lot of performance can be gained by measuring how an elements appearance will change after applying a function then applying it in a single step.
One can then sometimes animate the difference using properties which only trigger compositing to gain a smooth transition.

Animating properties which cause affect layout will trigger a relayout on every frame. For example this awful scene here: [slide]

Although it doesn't look like much (and is probably rendering pretty smooth) it is making my fan spin up and get's my phone really hot. With more content or images this would be evident as Jank.

In this example I am animating the 'width' property of the DOM element. This is one of the properties which triggers layout. It is being changed and so requires a re-layout every single frame by the css animation.

***A good general motto is to calculate all DOM changes first then apply them in a single step.***

# But why is layout so hard on the browser?
Layout is very hard to calculate because changing a single element could have an effect on every single other element on the page. This also invalidates the bitmap of the element in memory so it has to be repainted.

Another reason is the rendering of typefaces. Type is so ubiquitous about the web it is very easily to take it for granted but it is very difficult to render especially when you appreciate that every character needs to be kerned and hinted, every word and paragraph needs to be placed and flowed correctly.

## How come compositing is so fast then?
Rotating or scaling is all done off the main thread on your phone/desktop's graphics chip. Also graphics cards are very good at applying transforms. The transforms on a single webpage are nothing compared to a modern computer game.
