The current wave of VR devices are known as head mounted displays. HMDs.

HMDs mostly consist of position sensors, a display and two lenses to distort the image for a wider Field of View.

These are the ones which are coming out soon...

Out of these cardboard is an order of magnitude cheaper and doesn't require any specialist equipment to use beyond a smart phone.

With it's low barrier of entry it goes hand in hand with the open internet.

## There are two broad categories of expereince

Prerendered experiences you can just look around in such as those recorded by Google's Jump.

The other type is realtime animation experiences.

These are rendered at 60fps by the device. 

They can involve interactivity and procedurally generated content.

I haven't got long to cover what is a vast and fractal like field so I am
going to touch on building a VR experience in THREE from the perspective of a developer.

One of the most ubiquitous libraries for 3D animation in the web is THREE.js.

It has numerous examples which can be toyed with to get a deeper undeerstanding on how it works.

I'm going to start by covering the fundamentals.
