# When is a good time to measure?

* Before any thing is even loaded, if possible precalculated what you need and send it down.
* On interaction you have ~100ms before it feels slow. Which is a lot of time to calculate stuff.

# Bad
* As soon as the page has loaded, the user is expecting instantaeneous interactivity and will feel bad if there isn't any.
* Whilst animation is happening. Scrolling, swiping, dragging etc.. Jutters here will make the experience feel very not-native.
