This scene is very simple.

I've defined a few lights and made some shapes

The lamposts all share the same geometry to save on memory

I prerendered the lighting so that the floor looks really nicely lit at no cost.

And I added some pieces of empty geometry to define where later I will draw some sprites.

I've installed the THREE.js exporter (It's built into clara.io)

By Selecting scene it ensures that the entire scene is exported.

One important thing to note is that Blender defines a different Coordinate system to THREE.js so THREE performs a transformation to make it match.

So if you have issues where geometry is pointing the wrong way that is why

Clara.io webapp does not have this problem and has the exporter built in, it may be a better place to start.
