# Setting it up for VR

Attatching the camera to the Device Orientation Conroller

In an ideal world we wouldn't have to hard code support for devices and rely on the device orientation controller.

Which is where the WebVR comes in.

# WebVR

Gives access to the VR Device sensors via:

`HMDVRDevice` - optical properties of the device - information on how to distort the image so that HMDs such as the Rift and will display it correctly.

`PositionSensorVRDevice` - Access to the Position/Rotation of Headset - current library uses the device orientation api.
