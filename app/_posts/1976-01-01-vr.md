# Setting it up for VR

Attatching the camera to the Device Orientation Conroller

In an ideal world we wouldn't have to hard code support for devices and rely on the device orientation controller.

Which is where the WebVR comes in.

# WebVR

Gives access to the VR Device sensors via:

`HMDVRDevice` - optical properties of the device - information on how to distort the image so that HMDs such as the Rift and will display it correctly.

`PositionSensorVRDevice` - Access to the Position/Rotation of Headset - current library uses the device orientation api.

 #Tips:
 * When moving the camera keep the camera's distance from the floor the same to avoid a weird floaty disconnect feeling.
 * Keep a consistent 60 fps frame rate.
 * Don't rotate or teleport the camera, you will make the user sick or confused.
 * Be aware of vertigo
 * Be prepared for a user to start facing in an unintended direction
 * Most users don't realize they can turn around and will only face one direction
 * Load assets as they are needed after 7-10s of loading the user will get bored and leave
 * Use a Service Worker to precache assets in a seperate thread (Android Only)
 * A reticule will help avoid motion sickness
 * An app manifest will ensure the device starts in the correct orientation
