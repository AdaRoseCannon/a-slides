# SIMD

On the more realistic side of things there is an upcoming API which will allow you to do parallel data processing on the cpu in the web.

It is called ***SIMD***.

It will allow one to perform simultaeneous calculations by mapping four numbers as dimensions of a 4 vector and do 4 operations at once.

In a way very similar to the way shaders do on the graphics chip.

It is still on the cpu but should be able to process a large dataset much faster.

A factor of 4, 8 or 16 faster.

It can be used now in firefox nightly

and used in wrapped webapps by shipping with chrome which has SIMD compiled in, Intel XDK can do this for you.

Or you can just wait a bit.
