## SIMD

On the more realistic side of things one will be able to perform paralell maths using vectors when the SIMD API is implemented.
SIMD is an upcoming JavaScript API. It will allow one to perform simultaeneous calculations by mapping four numbers as dimensions of a 4 vector and do 4 operations at once. It is still on the cpu but should be able to process a large dataset a factor of 4 faster.

It can be used now in firefox nightly and wrapped webapps by shipping with chrome which has SIMD compiled in. I believe Intel XDK can do this for you.
