# Conclusion, Make it feel fast,

* Make sure scrolling/dragging is responsive
* Make it behave from the moment the page is loaded.
* Manage user expectations, don't show what they cannot interact with
* Measure everything first then render second
* Move as much as possible out of the main thread, into workers or onto the graphics card.
* * but beware of serialization costs of transferring data between threads.
