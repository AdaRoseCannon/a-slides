#Tips:
* When moving the camera keep the camera's distance from the floor the same to avoid a weird floaty disconnect feeling.
* Keep a consistent 60 fps frame rate.
* Don't rotate or teleport the camera, you will make the user sick or confused.
* Be aware of vertigo
* Be prepared for a user to start facing in an unintended direction
* Most users don't realize they can turn around and will only face one direction
* Load assets as they are needed after 7-10s of loading the user will get bored and leave
* Use a Service Worker to precache assets in a seperate thread (Android Only)
* A reticule will help avoid motion sickness
* An app manifest will ensure the device starts in the correct orientation
