# Cardboard Talk

The Cardboard is an open hardware Virtual reality headset which can be bought cheaply or built even cheaper. 

Requiring just a smartphone which supports device orientation and graphics rendering.

With the initiatives to produce afforable phones for new markets. More of the the world is geting online via their phones.

[Show new hardware uptake]

By producing Virtual Reality content accessible through the web. Virtual Reality can share experiences around the Globe.

With no apps to download, no additional expensive hardware, only some cardboard and lenses we'll be able to step into each other's shoes.

# Two types of VR content which can be produced

## Pre recorded Video or pre-rendered animation.

This is content which has been recorded using specialty camera equipment,

[Google Camera thing]

or rendered for VR on a computer.

[That film which was (kickstarted?) for VR]

this content can be released through youtube and played through a smartphone's youtube app.

This allows you to experience snapshots of anywhere on the planet.

and off planet too

It has downsides of: 
 * can be very expensive to produce
 * live action requires intense post processing to calculate the depth in each camera.
 * It is non interactive

 I'm looking forawrd to a world where a school child's smartphone isn't a nuisance in the classroom but the tool to take a class on a school trip to the ISS, Antartica, Mars, New Delhi or New York.

# Realtime Graphics Content

Realtime graphics content can be produced by a small team of 3d artists and developers.

It can be educational, artistic, fun and surreal.

You can design a fully immersive experience for your users to have them experience your ideas in a way they likely never have before with only Â£15

This talk is going to primarily be about building VR experiences in the mobile Web Browser.

Starting with the fundamentals of 3D.

# The illusion of depth

# Defining shapes in 3D space

# Tools for authoring content

Blender, Maya, (That online one I used briefly)

# Animation

Tween, pre baked animation

# Interactivity

Input devices, touch, controllers, sound, other?! 

# Physics 

Cannon JS, Verlet-System

# Skills needed

Desigining 3D is an artform. And very rewarding. Developers should take a look at Maya and Blender, artists should take a look at Sculptris, z-brush and Mudbox for painting sculpture.

Animators are especially important. 

Most people working with 3D end up being jacks of all trades and a master of one.
