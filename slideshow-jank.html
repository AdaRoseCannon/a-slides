<p>The user shouldn&#39;t feel their very expensive device is struggling to display a simple a web page.</p>

<p>Goal framerate of 60fps, which gives us 16ms to render a single frame.</p>

<p>When the frame takes longer to layout and render than 16ms that is jank.</p>

<p>It looks like a stuttery discontinuity in the animation.</p>

<p>Jank shows up in the timeline as very tall bars</p>

<p>It&#39;s been shown that 60fps with occasional hiccoups feels much slower than a continuous 30fps.</p>

<p>Long frames caused by too much blocking activity in the main thread.</p>

<p>Can be an intense cpu bound operation or blocking IO (localstorage, sync ajax)</p>

<p>However most commonly on a typical webpage slowness is caused by the layouts and paints used to render the page.</p>

<p>A very simple view of the render pipeline is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Measure Element&#39;s position and size in the <em>Layout</em> step.</li>
<li>Certain elements are rendered into bitmaps in memory in the <em>paint</em> step</li>
<li>The graphics card then draws these bitmaps to the screen in the <em>composite</em> step</li>
</ul>

<p>üê¢ Layout is slowest.</p>

<ul>
<li>Layout - browser calculates the positions and sizes of all the elements in the page.</li>
<li>Making a small DOM change could potentially invalidate the entire DOM tree</li>
<li>An invalidated DOM is recalculated when each frame is rendered. </li>
<li>it is also recalculated whenver layout properties are read</li>
<li>So layout may be recalculated many times in a single frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>üê¢ An element needs to be repainted when it&#39;s appearance changes such as font-family or background colour.
If an element&#39;s layout changes its also needs to be repainted.</p>

<p>üê∞ Composite is very fast. Composite only involves the graphics card rerendering from bitmaps calculated in paint and stored in memory: it is performed when the page is being drawn to the screen. It is triggered by gfx card-only operations such as transform, clipping and opacity. </p>

<p><a href="http://csstriggers.com/" target="_blank">CSS triggers</a> is a great resource for discovering how properties trigger each of these operations.</p>

<p>One should try to touch layout properties rarely but can be pretty free with animating compositing properties.</p>
