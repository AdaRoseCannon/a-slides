<h1>Removing work from the main thread.</h1>

<p>The Web for many years was single threaded.
Now we have web workers they allow us to offload some work into additional threads on the cpu.
So we can leave the main thread to focus on performing the rendering operations.</p>

<ul>
<li>JSON parzing is slow.</li>
<li>We can use web workers (or the Service Worker) to perform our ajax requests and parze the JSON off of the main thread.</li>
<li>We can then query bits of the JSON through the postMessage or MessageChannel apis.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can also use workers to do complex calculations which do not rely on interacting with the DOM.</p>

<p>Compression library to expand data recieved in an ajax request. This data can then be processed in the worker and queried from the main thread.</p>

<p>On the lighter side; If your website&#39;s winter holiday theme has realtime physically correct snowfall then perhaps perform these calculations in a worker and transfer the positions/rotations of each snowflake back to the main thread for rendering.</p>

<p>But beware, there is a hidden cost of using workers. Transferring the data back to the main thread is not free. It needs to be deserialised in the main thread. So if you download a JSON file and parze it in a worker then send the whole object back to the main thread you gain NOTHING. The main thread still has to deserialize back into a JavaScript object.</p>

<p>So make sure you only send what you need for rendering back to the main thread.</p>
